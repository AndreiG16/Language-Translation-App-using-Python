This Python script creates a language translation application using the Hugging Face Transformers library and Gradio for the user interface. The project allows users to input English text and select a target language (German, French, or Romanian) from a dropdown menu. The translation is performed using pre-trained translation models from Hugging Face. The translated text is displayed on the web page. The Gradio interface provides a simple and interactive way for users to experience language translation without the need for coding. The project is intended to be used as a language translation tool and showcases the integration of Transformers and Gradio for building user-friendly applications.
